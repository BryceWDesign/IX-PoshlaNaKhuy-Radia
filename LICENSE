🛠 PURPOSE  
This project is developed and released exclusively for humanitarian, environmental, and scientific use. Its primary mission is to reduce, neutralize, and recover environmental radiation in contaminated zones using real-world, buildable technologies that are safe for both humans and animals.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ PERMITTED USES  
You are permitted to:

1. **Study, use, and modify this project** for peaceful environmental cleanup, public health, and ecological recovery operations.

2. **Deploy and reproduce this system** in radiation-contaminated zones, including (but not limited to) regions within Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Japan, or any global site affected by airborne or ground radiation exposure.

3. **Incorporate or adapt these technologies** into aircraft, drones, ground vehicles, or other delivery platforms as long as the intended purpose remains non-violent and environmentally focused.

4. **Share this work freely**, as long as the LICENSE and README attribution remain intact.
