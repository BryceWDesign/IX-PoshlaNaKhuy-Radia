# IX-PoshlaNaKhuy-Radia

## Overview  
**IX-PoshlaNaKhuy-Radia** is an open-source, real-world engineering solution designed to extract and neutralize harmful airborne radiation from contaminated environments — using fully buildable, verifiable, and non-military technologies.

This system is intended for **deployment in regions affected by radiation**, including areas in **Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Japan, and others**. The goal is to support the **restoration of safe living conditions** for **families, children, and wildlife** through modular, self-powered, and scalable technology.

## Mission

To provide a **non-theoretical, real-world tool** that can:
- Extract radioactive particulates from the air
- Power itself using ambient radiation and EM field scavenging
- Function independently or be mounted on drones, aircraft, or mobile units
- Be built and deployed by anyone with access to common tools and materials

---

## Legal and Ethical Scope

- **This is a humanitarian project.**
- It is released under a custom license forbidding all military, weaponized, or surveillance-based use.
- It is **not affiliated with any government or military**.
- The technologies within are based entirely on **scientific principles and real-world components**, without fiction, speculation, or classified systems.

---

## Purpose of This Repository

- To enable **any civilian or relief group** to construct and deploy a radiation-cleaning system using open-source plans.
- To help communities still suffering from past disasters like **Chernobyl**, **Mayak**, and **Fukushima**.
- To ensure that **wildlife and future generations** can return safely to these areas without fear of ongoing exposure.

## Upcoming Contents

This repository will include:
- ✅ A full LICENSE with international legal protection
- ✅ A detailed Bill of Materials (BOM)
- ✅ Complete build instructions
- ✅ Schematic diagrams
- ✅ Harmonic field integration modules
- ✅ Real-world performance benchmarks
- ✅ Optional deployment adaptations (for aircraft, vehicles, etc.)

## A Note on the Name

The project name “**IX-PoshlaNaKhuy-Radia**” includes transliterated Russian **мат** — a cultural expression of frustration and resolve.  
It is not intended as aggression or insult, but as an **unfiltered declaration** that enough is enough:  
> “Radiation, go f*ck yourself — we’re cleaning this up now.”
