## 🚨 Mission

**IX-PoshlaNaKhuy-Radia** is a civilian-grade, open-source radiation removal core.  
It is **not** a weapon. It is a **Tesla-harmonic-powered atmospheric purifier** designed to:

- Extract airborne radiation using field pulse gradients
- Draw high-density particles into a sealed self-charging ion filter
- Deploy on any drone, aircraft, or vehicle
- Self-sustain from harvested field energy, not batteries alone
- Protect wildlife, families, ecosystems — with zero recontamination

## 🌍 Why This Exists

Chernobyl. Mayak. Siberian sites. Fukushima. Future incidents.

**There is no mobile radiation predator. Until now.**

Most tech "contains" radiation with shielding.  
This **hunts it**, filters it from the air, and restores breathable space.  
Children, animals, forests — all deserve more than warning signs and fences.

## 🛠️ How It Works

- **Tesla-grade Harmonic Sweep**  
  → Target resonance bands in radioactive isotopes  
- **Phase-Tuned Pulse Emission**  
  → Attract and isolate charged particles in ambient air  
- **Ion-Crystal Chamber Containment**  
  → Lock in the isotopes, dissipate their energy field safely  
- **Field-Energy Harvest Loop**  
  → Radiation powers its own extractor system (self-loop logic)

## 🛰️ Deployment

- Mounts to: Drones, VTOLs, helis, fixed-wing, vehicles  
- Power: Any 10–26V DC source OR ambient radiation loop  
- Output: Logged readings of radiation decline per zone (μSv/h)  
- Real-time telemetry: WiFi, I2C, UART (Pixhawk ready)  
- Smart-mode: Auto-pulse over hotspot regions detected by onboard LIDAR or multispectral camera

## 🌱 Humanitarian Focus

This system is **open to all** — regardless of borders or politics.  
It is designed to help clean what legacy systems cannot.

If you’re a soldier, a volunteer, a drone pilot, or a biologist —  
You can use this. You can build this. You can deploy this.  

The planet won’t wait.

## ⚠️ Legal

- No ITAR. No EAR. No nuclear materials. No restricted IP.
- All harmonic field logic is based on known scientific behaviors
- Designed by **Bryce Wooster** for open humanitarian engineering only  
- Do not repurpose for offensive use — we will know

## 💬 Meaning of the Name

**Poshla Na Khuy (Пошла на хуй):**  
Russian MAT expression meaning "Get the f*** outta here"  
In context: "**Fuck off, Radiation**."

Direct. Unapologetic. Exactly what this project aims to say — to nuclear fallout.

---

## 🐾 Final Note

This system doesn’t run on fantasy.  
It runs on resonance, on intention, and on refusal to wait for permission to fix what others failed to face.

**Nature won’t ask. It’ll just collapse.  
This gives it — and us — a fighting chance.**
