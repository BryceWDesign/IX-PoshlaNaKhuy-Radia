# IX-RadiaCore System Schematic

## Purpose  
This document outlines the core architecture of the **IX-RadiaCore** ‚Äî the standalone radiation extraction unit powering the IX-PoshlaNaKhuy-Radia project. This module is designed for aerial, vehicular, or fixed-location deployment and forms the technological heart of the system.

The goal is to **draw airborne radiation particles**, **trap or neutralize them**, and **convert their field energy** into usable power for onboard subsystems or external routing.

---

## Core Functions
The IX-RadiaCore performs four simultaneous tasks:

1. **Radiation Particle Capture**
   - Using electrostatic and magnetic field gradients to draw in ionized airborne isotopes (e.g. Cs-137, Sr-90)
   
2. **Field Energy Scavenging**
   - Converting ambient EM and radioactive ion energy into usable electrical power
   
3. **Directed Field Compression**
   - Focusing field draw into a zone of maximum particle pull using Tesla-based harmonic convergence

4. **Safe Containment + Filtration**
   - Absorbing or isolating captured isotopes via replaceable filter banks (zeolites, boronized mesh, etc.)

- **Weight:** ~4.7kg with shielding
- **Mounting Options:** Flat bracket, rail system, or suspension hooks
- **Power Output (theoretical):** 30‚Äì140W peak in high-radiation zones (Chernobyl-class)

---

## Scalability
- Multiple IX-RadiaCores can be daisy-chained for wide-area sweeping
- Clustered units form a **resonance net** for directional or surround-field draw

---

## Notes
- All components are either commercially available or fabricatable using documented processes
- Designed for low mechanical complexity and high field interaction density
- Optional ground discharge port and soil ion spike will be specified in secondary schematic
