# Safety & Handling

## Electrical
- ESP uses **high voltage**. Enclose the ESP stage; use interlocks that disable HV when the service panel opens. Provide bleeder resistors to discharge plates within <30 seconds of power-off.

## Contamination control
- Treat used HEPA/carbon as **potentially contaminated** if operated near radioactive sources.
- Use **bag-in/bag-out** change method. Wear appropriate PPE (gloves, mask), work over containment tray, label and seal used media.

## Transport & disposal
- Follow local regulations for **radioactive or potentially contaminated waste**. Coordinate with licensed facilities if needed; never dispose filters casually.

## Measurement hygiene
- Place dosimeters at fixed, repeatable geometries; avoid moving sources toward detectors (apparent “dose drop” can be a geometry artifact).
- Do not claim “radiation removal” (gamma/neutron). Device is for **aerosol capture & monitoring**.
