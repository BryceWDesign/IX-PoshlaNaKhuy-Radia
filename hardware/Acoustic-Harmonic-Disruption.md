# Acoustic Harmonic Disruption  
**IX-RadiaCore ‚Äî Directional Soundfield System for Resonance Disruption and Particle Destabilization**

This module introduces acoustic wavefront logic ‚Äî using harmonic pressure patterns to:
- Destabilize suspended radioactive particulates  
- Amplify Tesla field convergence zones  
- Target resonance bands in high-exposure zones  
- Create destructive interference in localized micro-environments

## üîä 1. Operating Theory

Radiation particles (especially airborne alpha/beta contaminants) can be:
- Loosely bound to aerosols or moisture  
- Weakly bonded to surface irregularities  
- Suspended in turbulent flow patterns

By using **controlled acoustic pulses**, we can:
- **Agitate and release** those bindings  
- **Force convergence** toward field vectors (Tesla coil intake zone)  
- **Disrupt electrostatic equilibrium**, increasing collection probability

## üîâ 2. Frequency & Harmonic Bands

| Mode | Frequency Range | Effect |
|------|------------------|--------|
| Resonant Agitation | 100Hz ‚Äì 2kHz | Shakes loose bonded particles |
| Harmonic Focus | 432Hz / 528Hz | Enhances EM resonance fields |
| Disruptive Pulse | 2kHz ‚Äì 10kHz burst | Breaks clumps and clings |
| Cancelation Sweep | Phase-offset range | Counter-vibrational nulling |

## üîß 3. Hardware Components

| Component | Spec |
|----------|------|
| Driver | Class-D Amp (TPA3116 or TPA3255) |
| Transducer | Exciter Disc or Piezo Array |
| Speaker | Neodymium directional 3" or horn tweeter |
| Control | ESP32 or STM32 w/ DAC output or PWM wave shaping |
| Power | Shared with core bus (12V or boost-regulated) |

## üß† 4. Control Logic

1. MCU generates sweep pattern or selects mode  
2. Audio waveform modulated via DAC or PWM  
3. Amp drives speaker/exciter  
4. Sound energy projected into intake zone (or 360¬∞ dispersion)  
5. Particle destabilization measured by:
   - Increased Geiger delta CPS  
   - Field impedance drop  
   - RF noise profile shift

Optional:
- Add dynamic mic for feedback loop tuning  
- Use FFT module for resonance mapping

## üß± 5. Physical Layout

| Position | Mounting |
|----------|----------|
| Forward horn | Attached under Tesla coil throat (focus blast inward) |
| Side exciters | Mounted on frame sides for acoustic bubble |
| Top array | Optional for omni-directional burst |
| Shielding | Isolate amp & coil paths via copper mesh grounding |

Vibration dampers must be used to avoid false readings from Geiger or MCU logic.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 6. Power and Safety Notes

- Class-D amps must be cooled with small heatsink or airflow  
- Avoid ultrasonic frequencies near biological zones (keep ‚â§ 15kHz)  
- Ensure sound pressure < 95dB at 1m for sustained ops  
- For hostile/abandoned zones, burst mode may exceed 100dB for 1‚Äì2s max

## ‚úÖ Summary

Acoustic harmonic systems offer:
- **Non-contact destabilization** of radiation vectors  
- **Low-power augmentation** of field capture zones  
- **Resonance pattern reinforcement** for Tesla draw precision  
- **Multi-mode operation** with real-time control

> Sound is not just vibration. It‚Äôs command ‚Äî when you speak the right frequency.
