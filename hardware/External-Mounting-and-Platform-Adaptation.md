# External Mounting and Platform Adaptation  
**IX-RadiaCore — Modular Deployment Integration Guide**

This file provides clear guidance on how to mount the IX-RadiaCore system onto a wide variety of platforms, including:

- Drones (UAVs or quadcopters)  
- Ground vehicles or robotic rovers  
- Helicopters or aircraft  
- Stationary towers or utility poles

Each method uses **existing hardware standards** and **non-proprietary components** for full global accessibility.

## ⚙️ 1. Universal Mount Interface

The IX-RadiaCore chassis is built around a **universal bracket rail system** compatible with:

- **20mm or 30mm extrusion profiles**  
- **VESA-compatible mounts**  
- **Quick-release pin-lock or bolt plate systems**  
- **ISO flatbed + gimbal quick connectors**

The base plate includes:
- 4 x M6 bolt holes (standard quad layout)
- Center tap for vibration-dampened isolator
- Side lugs for cable tie or harness loop attachment

---

## 🛸 2. Drone / UAV Mounting

### Compatibility
- Any quadcopter or hexacopter with ≥7kg payload capacity  
- Preferred: Carbon-fiber or aluminum frames with center rail

### Mounting Procedure
- Attach to center of gravity via carbon plate + vibration isolators  
- Connect power (if needed) via drone battery BEC or solar overlay  
- Route telemetry via UART or I2C if feedback loop is installed  
- Ensure draw vents face **forward or downward** for airflow enhancement  
- Balance prop wash to avoid particle recirculation

> 💡 **Optional Add-on:** Thermal shielding + Kevlar skirt in high radiation zones

---

## 🚚 3. Ground Vehicle or Rover

### Compatibility
- Small mobile robot (e.g. ROS platform)
- Full-size ATV, UGV, or hazmat rover

### Mounting Procedure
- Secure with vibration plate + rubber isolators  
- Add quick-release bottom plate for hot-swap field use  
- Route cable from vehicle power system (12V/24V) into DC input rail  
- Adjust field-of-flow direction using servo pivot base (optional)

---

## 🚁 4. Aircraft / Helicopter

### Compatibility
- Utility drone wings  
- Chopper skid rail systems  
- Wing pylons or external cargo pods

### Mounting Procedure
- Mount to belly or rail using aviation-approved quick-release brackets  
- Use Kevlar + boron mesh shielding if operating near plume zone  
- Optional: Route data to pilot HUD or relay computer via CAN/I2C  
- Balance lateral drag in fixed-wing platforms

---

## 🏗️ 5. Static Tower / Mast Deployment

### Compatibility
- Tripod, scaffolding, or pole mount  
- Existing utility towers or contaminated site poles

### Mounting Procedure
- Use rear mounting holes or ratcheting strap frame  
- Orient unit’s intake facing **prevailing wind** or contaminant source  
- Optional: Solar panel + ultracap pack for standalone field power  
- Data port can log onto SD or transmit via LoRa/Satcom

## 💡 Integration Tips

| Situation | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| High wind zone | Use aerodynamic fairing or shroud |
| Radiation plume | Face intake **upwind** + add vented rear exhaust |
| Night ops | Use thermals or EMF tracker for guidance |
| Animal-rich zones | Elevate mount >2m to avoid interference |

## 🔄 Quick-Swap Field Kit

- Preloaded filter stack cartridges  
- Plug-and-play vibration-dampened mount blocks  
- EMI-shielded power cable extension  
- Mount in <4 minutes with 2 tools

---

## ✅ Summary

The IX-RadiaCore platform is designed for **total deployment flexibility**, able to attach to:

- Drones  
- Ground units  
- Aerial vehicles  
- Fixed platforms  

...with **no specialized equipment**, only real-world parts and open-access formats.
