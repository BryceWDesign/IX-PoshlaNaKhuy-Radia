# IX-RadiaCore — Field Deployment Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive **pre-deployment and operational checklist** for the safe, effective use of the IX-RadiaCore system in radiation-contaminated zones.

These procedures are designed for **real-world humanitarian use**, by both trained personnel and informed civilians. All equipment and actions must follow regional safety guidelines.

## 🧷 Pre-Deployment: Preparation

- [ ] **Inspect chassis** for physical damage, loose connections, or cracked insulation  
- [ ] **Verify EMI shielding** integrity inside housing  
- [ ] **Ensure all filters are fresh** (HEPA, zeolite, boron mesh, acoustic baffle)  
- [ ] **Test high-voltage supply** (20–40kV range) with multimeter + safety probe  
- [ ] **Charge capacitors** or ensure ambient scavenging loop is functional  
- [ ] **Test harmonic coil driver** (3/6/9 output cycle confirmed)  
- [ ] **Ensure audio disruptor circuit** is active and within decibel limits (<130dB)  
- [ ] **Confirm airflow path** is unobstructed from intake to filter exhaust  
- [ ] **Install in protective case or vehicle bracket**, depending on deployment platform

---

## 🌍 Site Conditions Checklist

- [ ] Radiation levels confirmed via **Geiger or dosimeter**  
- [ ] Wind conditions below 12 mph for optimal capture efficiency  
- [ ] Zone marked for **“Active Particle Capture – Radiation Recovery In Progress”**  
- [ ] Distance from inhabited areas: minimum **30 meters**, unless in “clean-up mode”  
- [ ] Soil not heavily disturbed (prevents rising dust plume contamination)

---

## ⚙️ Activation Procedure

1. [ ] Flip system to **“HV Pre-charge” mode** — hold 10 seconds
2. [ ] Switch to **“Active Draw” mode** — audible hum and harmonic tone should begin
3. [ ] Monitor **ion capture LEDs or EMF meter**, confirm field convergence is engaged
4. [ ] Log radiation levels every **30 minutes** using portable counter
5. [ ] Replace filters as needed during long sessions (or every 24–48 hours)

---

## ☢️ Post-Deployment Shutdown

- [ ] Switch to **“Discharge” mode** for 30–60 seconds to bleed residual charge  
- [ ] Turn off all subsystems via master control toggle  
- [ ] Remove filter cartridge, seal in radiation-safe container  
- [ ] Log deployment time, field readings, and device performance  
- [ ] Transport unit in **Faraday case or grounded enclosure** if moving between zones

---

## 🧪 Maintenance Checklist

- [ ] Replace filters after 24–72 hours depending on field load  
- [ ] Clean mesh plates with isopropyl alcohol (wear gloves)  
- [ ] Test capacitors for leakage once every 10 charge cycles  
- [ ] Re-tune Tesla driver once per month or after coil replacement  
- [ ] Check liquid metal core (GaInSn) for signs of oxide formation or contamination  
- [ ] Confirm grounding wires are intact and continuous

---

## ⚠️ Warnings & Safety

- NEVER open the device while HV system is powered  
- ALWAYS wear PPE when handling used filters or contaminated surfaces  
- DO NOT use device in heavy rainfall without sealed enclosure  
- AVOID using near critical medical devices or RF-sensitive electronics  
- Ensure animals and people remain **outside the active draw radius** unless zone is being cleared

---

## 📓 Recommended Tools to Carry

- Digital dosimeter  
- Portable EMF/ion detector  
- Thermal camera (optional, for hotspot ID)  
- Extra filters  
- ESD gloves + mask  
- Anti-static grounding cable  
- Multimeter with HV probe  
- Wipe-down kit (alcohol, wipes, disposal bags)

IX-RadiaCore was built for frontline use — but **safe handling and data logging are essential** for ethical and legal operation.
