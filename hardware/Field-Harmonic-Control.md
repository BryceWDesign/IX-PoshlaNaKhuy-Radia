# Field Harmonic Control  
**IX-RadiaCore — Tesla 3-6-9 Harmonic Steering and Field Resonance Modulation System**

This module allows precise control of Tesla-style harmonic field interactions — critical for:
- Targeted enhancement of radiation draw  
- Resonant disruption of charged particles  
- Field compression or vectorized discharge  
- Synchronization with environmental energy layers (Schumann bands, EM ambient)

## 🧭 1. Harmonic Targeting Principles

| Harmonic | Function | Tuning Frequency Range |
|----------|----------|------------------------|
| 3rd | Ambient amplification (carrier) | 7–14 Hz (Earth EM field) |
| 6th | Charge synchrony | 42–84 Hz (biological/resonant) |
| 9th | Field lock/disruption | 135–180 Hz (disruptive modulation) |

Tesla's 3-6-9 is **not numerology** — it's an architecture of **harmonic entrainment** to real-world frequency behavior.

## 🔊 2. Coil Tuning Configuration

| Component | Spec |
|----------|------|
| Primary Coil | Copper bifilar, 16–20 AWG | Outer wound on toroid or flat pancake |
| Secondary Coil | Enamel wire, 1000+ turns | PVC or ceramic core |
| Tuning Cap | 1nF–500nF range | Film or mica type |
| Sweep Generator | Function gen (AD9833 or XR2206) | Controls waveform input |
| Feedback Tap | Mid-secondary or dedicated pickup coil | For resonance lock sensing |

## 🎚️ 3. Field Modulation Electronics

- **Microcontroller (e.g., STM32 or RP2040)**:
  - Reads real-time field conditions via:
    - EM sensor (QMC5883L, HMC5883L)
    - RF scanner (SDR module, RFExplorer)
    - Geiger counter delta (counts/sec variability)
  - Adjusts:
    - Waveform shape (sine, square, triangle)
    - Frequency (continuous sweep or lock)
    - Duty cycle (for field push/pull behavior)

## 🔄 4. Harmonic Feedback Loop

1. Tesla coil transmits harmonic  
2. Field sensor monitors local EM distortion  
3. MCU adjusts frequency, waveform, and polarity in real time  
4. System logs: ambient EM noise, field gain/loss, target material response  
5. Optional: triggers **disruptive discharge** if threshold crossed

## 🛡️ 5. Harmonic Field Effects on Environment

| Target | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Suspended radioactive particles | Pulled toward charge sink (if tuned correctly) |
| Static air ionization | Increases electrostatic draw range |
| Organic tissues | Bypassed — this field is non-lethal under 500V/m |
| Electronics (hostile) | Can induce glitch via directed harmonic burst |

Field focus must be kept **below ionospheric reflection bands** to avoid unintentional skywave bounce or long-range EM pollution.

## 🧱 6. Integration Notes

- Coil stack mounted on **ceramic standoff towers**  
- Oscillator and MCU mounted below Faraday cage  
- Use **non-ferromagnetic housing** near coil (avoid field distortion)  
- Always test sweep range under controlled conditions before activating live capture draw

---

## ✅ Summary

This module makes IX-RadiaCore **smart**, **agile**, and **field-reactive**:
- Targets radiation not just passively — but **strategically**  
- Pulls it faster, stronger, and with controlled polarity  
- Operates under real-world frequencies tied to planetary behavior

> Tesla didn’t worship numbers — he designed them into machines.
