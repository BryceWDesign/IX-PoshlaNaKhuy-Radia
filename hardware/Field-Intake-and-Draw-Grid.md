# Field Intake and Draw Grid  
**IX-RadiaCore — Particle Convergence, Airflow Capture, and Tesla Harmonic Pull**

This document defines the physical and electromagnetic interface where radioactive contaminants are drawn into the neutralization system.

## 🌀 1. Conceptual Layout

The system creates a **multi-mode capture zone** using:
- Directed airflow (filtered passive or assisted)
- Electrostatic grid attraction
- Tesla field resonance pull (non-contact, low-current EM sweep)
- Acoustic disruption (from prior module)

This zone acts like a **predatory maw** — pulling in suspended particles and destabilizing molecular adherence from aerosols, skin, or water vapor.

## ⚙️ 2. Grid Structure and Layers

### Layered Construction (from outside in):

| Layer | Function |
|-------|----------|
| External Air Mesh | Coarse particle filtration (bugs, debris) |
| Electrostatic Charge Grid | High-voltage wireframe (~10kV, low current) |
| Harmonic Field Induction Layer | Tesla-driven EM field trap |
| Acoustic Node Ring (optional) | Sound field generation from previous module |
| Flow Shroud | Creates laminar intake boundary |
| Inner Isolation Chamber | Houses Geiger sensor + intake funnel |

---

## 🌬️ 3. Airflow Logic

### Passive:
- Wind or drone motion causes natural intake

### Active:
- 12V micro fan draws air inward (30–60mm unit)
- Or centrifugal blower (3D printable casing)
- Air directed through cone-shaped chamber toward sensor node

All flow must pass through electrostatic grid and Tesla-converged field.

## ⚡ 4. Electrostatic Grid

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| HV Source | DC Boost module (e.g., 3.7V to 10kV @ 50μA) |
| Wires | Fine copper or tungsten (0.2–0.5mm) |
| Spacing | ~10mm apart, suspended in ring frame |
| Mounting | Nylon standoffs + vented ring scaffold |
| Power Logic | Timer-based pulsing (1s ON / 4s OFF to save energy) |

This layer induces charge separation in airborne contaminants, increasing draw to Tesla field.

## 🔲 5. Harmonic Tesla Draw Layer

- Coil is embedded around intake throat or behind grid  
- Alternates low-energy pulse waves (resonant, not aggressive discharge)  
- Draws charged particles deeper toward collection zone  
- Reinforces convergence field for downstream capture

---

## 🔧 6. Construction Notes

- All outer layers removable for field cleaning  
- Use non-metallic fasteners to prevent shorting  
- Air mesh must be grounded to prevent corona arcs  
- Acoustic nodes tuned for forward and radial dispersion  
- Tesla wires insulated with heat shrink except radiative tips  
- Frame optionally printed in PETG or ABS (heat-resistant)

## 🧪 7. Integration Signal Map

| Sensor/Module | Input | Output | Action |
|---------------|-------|--------|--------|
| Geiger Pulse | CPS delta | MCU alert | Adjust fan + Tesla pulse |
| Temp Sensor | °C | MCU alert | Throttle airflow if overheated |
| EM Sensor | Tesla field | Amplitude | Detect particle congestion |
| Acoustic Feedback | FFT | Resonance match | Trigger pulse burst |

## ✅ Summary

The Field Intake Grid is:
- Scientifically structured  
- Modular  
- Grounded in real discharge, flow, and field convergence techniques  
- Core to the drone’s or vehicle’s radiation scavenging behavior

> The front of this device isn’t passive. It’s hungry. And it pulls with purpose.
