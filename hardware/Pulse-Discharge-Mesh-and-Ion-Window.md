# Pulse Discharge Mesh & Ion Window  
**Radiation Field Trap & Resonant Discharge Architecture**

This is the physical subassembly that handles:
- Collection of airborne radiation (alpha, beta, gamma, charged particles)
- Ion field trapping via energized mesh grid
- Controlled pulse-based neutralization or compression
- High-voltage short-burst Tesla-style discharges

---

## 📐 Overview

This module is built as a **layered plasma ion trap**, shaped like a shallow bowl or flat-grid frame. It uses:
- A bifilar-tuned central resonance node (Tesla coil or HV transformer)
- An outer **Faraday mesh** for radial neutralization
- Plasma ionization plates to pull charged radiation toward center
- Capacitor-timed burst gate to release/convert absorbed energy

## 🧩 Subsystem Breakdown

### 1. **Capture Mesh (Faraday Frame)**  
- Woven stainless steel or carbon-infused nylon  
- Diameter: 25–40 cm  
- Mesh spacing: 2–4 mm  
- Charged to ~300–800V (low-current) to attract ionized particles  
- Connected via opto-isolated SSR to pulse driver

### 2. **Ionization Window (Plasma Plate)**  
- Perforated aluminum or copper base  
- High-voltage input from Tesla core (~10–18 kV, <10 mA)  
- Produces visible ion corona during active pulses  
- Attracts + repels specific energy densities based on sweep freq

### 3. **Pulse Driver & Timing Gate**  
- 1000µF–2000µF cap bank  
- Triggered every 1–3 seconds depending on rad level  
- MOSFET or IGBT gated with logic-level input  
- Pulse duration: 50–200 ms  
- Controlled by microcontroller (see `/software/Main-Controller-Logic.md`)

### 4. **Tesla Resonance Core**  
- Small-scale bifilar Tesla coil tuned to 3-6-9 harmonic logic  
- Sweep from 18–55 kHz, pulsed  
- HV output drives plasma corona and field compression envelope  
- Secondary coil grounded via MOV or spark gap to prevent overvoltage

## 📊 Performance Logic

| Input Radiation (CPM) | Pulse Interval | Energy Draw per Burst | Visual Output       |
|------------------------|----------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| <500 CPM               | ~5 sec         | ~4W                    | Weak corona ring     |
| 500–1000 CPM           | ~2 sec         | ~7W                    | Moderate blue arc    |
| >1000 CPM              | ~1 sec         | ~11W                   | Strong pulse flash   |

🛠️ Materials List
Component	Material	Notes
Ion Plate	Copper / Alum	Perforated, 3mm holes preferred
Mesh Frame	Steel or Nylon	2–4 mm grid spacing
Support Ring	FR4 or PETG	Non-conductive outer housing
Cap Bank	Low ESR Electrolytic	Total 1000–2000µF @ 63V+
Pulse Switch	IGBT/MOSFET	TO-247 / TO-220, opto-isolated
HV Core	Custom Tesla Coil	~40 turns bifilar, 18–55kHz driver
Ventilation Ports	Slotted ABS	Direct airflow across plate and mesh

🧪 Field Use Considerations
Best deployed pointing downward in flight or at 45° angle on ground

Avoid metal contact with frame when active — capacitive arc risk

Recommended airflow: ≥ 2.5 m/s across plate via fan or motion

Clean ion plate with ethanol every 48 hrs in heavy deployment zones

✅ Summary
This is the physical heart of the system — where the air is filtered, the charge is redirected, and the invisible poison gets pulsed out of existence.

No lasers. No fake fields. Just air, charge, energy, and physics — executed with cruelty toward radiation and kindness toward life.
