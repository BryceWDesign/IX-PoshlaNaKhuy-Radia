# Radiation Capture Mechanism  
**IX-RadiaCore — Airborne Particle Capture and Electrostatic Draw System**

This subsystem targets the **core mission**: extract and trap harmful radioactive particles from contaminated air.

This is done through a **multi-stage capture approach**:
1. **Particulate filtration** (HEPA-grade and beyond)  
2. **Charged particle attraction** using high-voltage fields  
3. **Ionic saturation traps** for free-floating radionuclides  
4. **Swappable media** for disposal without hazard exposure

## ☢️ 1. Types of Target Radiation

| Type | Carrier | Can Be Captured? | Method |
|------|---------|------------------|--------|
| Alpha (α) | Dust, aerosols | ✅ Easily | Filter and charge trap |
| Beta (β) | Fine particulates, free-floating ions | ✅ | Static charge draw |
| Gamma (γ) | Not particulate | ❌ Requires shielding, not capture |
| Neutron | Rare airborne, localized | ⚠️ Capture not reliable | Requires heavy shielding |

**Focus**: Alpha and Beta emitters — the **largest environmental threat post-meltdown.**

## 🌀 2. Air Intake and Flow Architecture

### A. Suction Design
- Dual fan or turbine intake → draws high volumes of ambient air  
- Flow rate target: **100–500 L/min**, filtered inline  
- Dust pre-filter → HEPA main stage → charged zone

### B. Flow Control
- Laminar air channeling using vanes  
- Bypass shutoff via motorized gate if power exceeds limits  
- Reverse-purge pulse optional for filter unclogging

## ⚡ 3. Electrostatic Capture Stage

| Component | Spec |
|----------|------|
| Parallel plate or wire grid array | Stainless or copper rods |
| Voltage | 10–25 kV DC (from boost converter) |
| Polarity | Alternating array (+ – + –) or continuous negative bias |
| Insulation | PTFE standoffs and sealed dielectric body |
| Discharge safety | Bleed resistor array (10MΩ–100MΩ) |

**Function**: Ionized particles are drawn toward oppositely charged collector plates and trapped.

## 🧪 4. Ionic Resin Trap (Optional)

- After electrostatic zone, pass air over **anion/cation exchange resin bed**  
- Targets **Iodine-131, Cesium-137**, and similar soluble radionuclides  
- Replaceable cartridge, sealed, low maintenance  
- Resins: Purolite NRW600, Amberlite IRN97, or equivalent

## 🧱 5. HEPA and Nanofiber Filtration

| Stage | Purpose | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Pre-filter | Large dust/debris | Foam or carbon sponge |
| Stage 1 | HEPA H14 or ULPA | Traps >99.995% particles ≥0.3μm |
| Stage 2 | Charged mesh | Electrostatic support |
| Stage 3 | Optional resin | Ion trap (swappable cassette)

## 🔄 6. Disposal and Cartridge Replacement

- Filter housing: **slide-lock tray** with nitrile glove ports (no touch)  
- Indicator: **radioactive load sensor (via Geiger proximity + delta counter)**  
- Eject only if below threshold or in containment suit  
- Housing: double-wall leaded polymer or steel insert box

---

## 📦 7. Housing Materials and Maintenance

- Inner walls: grounded conductive liner  
- Outer walls: PTFE or ceramic epoxy for field insulation  
- Clean internal mesh every 30 cycles or after visible fouling  
- Replace full capture core every **3–6 months** depending on use case

---

## ✅ Summary

This mechanism enables the IX-RadiaCore to:
- Physically extract the source of airborne radiation  
- Operate in continuous or pulsed cycles  
- Self-power capture via onboard Tesla-derived field draw  
- Be mounted standalone, or inline with drone/vehicle air systems

Gamma and neutron shielding are handled in **separate structural components**, not this module.
