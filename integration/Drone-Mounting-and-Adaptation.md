# Drone Mounting and Adaptation System  
**Modular Deployment Rail for IX-PoshlaNaKhuy-Radia**

This file defines a **universal, platform-agnostic interface system** so the RadiaCore unit can be attached to:

- UAVs (quadcopters, hex, octo, tiltrotor)
- VTOL drones and eVTOL
- Fixed-wing aircraft (with underbelly or wing pods)
- Helicopter skids
- Ground vehicles or unmanned rovers

All integration points are **real-world**, no fictional mounts or fictive materials. Every spec listed below is based on existing drone or industrial hardware systems.

## 🔩 Structural Mounting System

### 📐 Baseplate
- **Material**: Carbon Fiber Reinforced Nylon or Aluminum 6061-T6
- **Size**: 210mm x 160mm
- **Weight Capacity**: >6kg static, 4.2kg dynamic rated
- **Attachment Points**: 6x M4 slotted holes, 25mm grid
- **Mounting Orientation**: Underslung or Top-Rail mount

### 🔧 Mounting Options

| Platform Type       | Mounting Method                | Notes                        |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Drone (quad/octo)   | Bottom plate (vibration dampers) | Supports air flow beneath   |
| Helicopter          | Skid-clamp adapters (U-bolt)     | Tool-free swap in 2 mins    |
| Fixed-wing          | Belly rail pod or pylon-mount    | Aerodynamic fairing optional|
| Rover / Vehicle     | Roof rack rail or bumper plate   | 12VDC adapter available     |

### 🧊 Thermal Isolation

Use 3mm high-temp silicone dampers between RadiaCore and frame.  
→ Reduces EMI transfer + vibration noise  
→ Preserves pulse integrity and sensor data

## 🔌 Power Integration

### Input Voltage Range
- 10V–26V DC input (protected)
- Reverse-polarity safe
- XT60 or XT90 standard (swappable adapter)

### Power Sources
- Drone battery tap (main bus or BEC)
- Separate LiFePO4 pack (2S–6S)
- Supercapacitor bank on drone rails
- Ground source (for tethered hover platforms)

## 🧠 Data & Telemetry Port

- 4-pin JST-GH (Pixhawk compatible)
- Protocols:
  - UART Serial (57600 baud default)
  - I2C for sensor feedback
  - ESP-NOW/WiFi optional via ESP32 module

Use this port to:
- Trigger Tesla pulse sweeps externally
- Log CPM and thermal data into drone’s FCU
- Activate pulse burst mode from ground control

---

## 🎯 Smart Trigger (Optional)

Install a downward LIDAR or multispectral camera:
- Triggers pulse sweep only when passing over **radioactive hotspot**
- Controlled by:
```python
if hotspot_detected:
    trigger_pulse_burst()
Works with:

Garmin LIDAR-Lite

FLIR Boson

DJI multispectral drone cameras

💡 Lighting and Visibility (Field Safe Mode)
Optional LED ring indicator:

Green: Passive mode

Yellow: Scanning

Red: Active pulse discharge

Can be linked to drone’s RC channel toggle

Makes field ops and drone swarms visible and safe

✅ Deployment Checklist
 Voltage matched and polarity checked

 Dampers installed (no hard contact)

 Telemetry tested on bench

 Pulse test fired in safe zone

 Mount stress-tested for vibration

🔐 Operational Notes
If deploying from NATO, BRICS, or humanitarian field teams: no export-controlled parts required

All telemetry non-encrypted by default unless user flashes secure firmware

Mount can be 3D-printed or CNC'd in <2h from .STL or DXF provided (see repo /cad/)
