# Telemetry and Diagnostics Interface  
**IX-PoshlaNaKhuy-Radia** — External Comms & Monitoring Layer

This file defines how field users monitor and interact with the RadiaCore system — wirelessly or via serial — to verify system health, radiation status, pulse behavior, and power draw.

All protocols are **non-fictional, real-world deployable**, and use common embedded or drone-ready hardware stacks.

## 📡 Communication Options

| Method         | Transport | Use Case                   |
|----------------|-----------|----------------------------|
| UART Serial    | USB-C/TTL | Local debugging / tethered |
| CANbus         | 2-wire    | Drone bus / vehicle mount  |
| ESP-NOW (ESP32)| RF        | Mesh wireless swarm        |
| WiFi (AP Mode) | TCP       | Tablet/laptop field monitor|

## 📦 Data Structure (JSON Serial Format)

The controller outputs diagnostics every `1000 ms` as JSON-encoded string:

```json
{
  "rad_cpm": 872,
  "temp_core": 42.5,
  "voltage_in": 11.8,
  "voltage_out": 24.2,
  "pulse_status": "ACTIVE",
  "sweep_freq": 41.3,
  "discharge_events": 14,
  "watchdog_reset": false
}
Use any terminal, drone flight controller, or custom dashboard to ingest this data. Libraries like ArduinoJson, pymodbus, or node-red can visualize it.

🔍 Field Diagnostic Flags
Flag Name	Description
pulse_status	ACTIVE, COOLDOWN, OFF, ERROR
watchdog_reset	True if system rebooted from instability
temp_core	Degrees Celsius from onboard thermistor
rad_cpm	Counts per minute (Geiger or SiPM sensor)
voltage_in/out	Current energy system status

Use these fields to:

Confirm radiation is being drawn and neutralized

Ensure Tesla pulse system is firing and stable

Monitor ambient energy health (battery, ZeroCell, solar)

Catch unexpected reboots, shorts, or thermal problems

🖥️ Example Tablet Display
Simple web dashboard (NodeMCU/ESP32 AP Mode):
-------------------------------------------------
  Radiation:         892 CPM
  Tesla Pulse:       ACTIVE @ 41.3 kHz
  Discharges Fired:  14
  In Voltage:        11.8V
  Out Voltage:       24.2V
  Core Temp:         42.5°C
  System Status:     NORMAL
-------------------------------------------------

🧪 Logging Format (Optional)
Use SD card or serial logger to store data:
timestamp,cpm,temp_c,vin,vout,status,pulse,discharge_count
1698240382,892,42.5,11.8,24.2,OK,ACTIVE,14

Use tools like:

RealTerm

PuTTY + log

Drone telemetry software

Custom ESP32/SD SPI logger

⚠️ System Alerts (if enabled)
Optional alert triggers:

CPM spike > 2000: emit 1kHz beep and flash onboard LED

Core temp > 65°C: pause sweep and notify

Power loss detected: send “LOW_VOLTAGE” warning and switch input

Telemetry not received for 10s: system assumes uplink failure

🔐 Security & Permissions
For humanitarian deployment in untrusted zones:

AP password: 12-char alphanum randomized per boot

All config changes must be local or via physical button hold

Telemetry-only mode by default; no OTA write access in public

✅ Summary
This file makes the system auditable, predictable, and trustworthy to anyone — even if they didn’t build it.

Whether viewed on a drone screen, laptop terminal, or rugged tablet, the telemetry interface gives every user full visibility into what’s working, what isn’t, and how to act fast if anything drifts.
